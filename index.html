            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as
                preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or
                apprenticeship. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large,
                or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some
                governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development
                Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits and personal development. Educational methods include
                teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place
                under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place
                in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,
                feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
